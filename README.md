## Compiling 
I prefer to use vscdoe for this if you dont want to use this to compile find out how yourself.

Just clone the project and click the compile button found at the top, this will create a folder called bin/debug/net7.0windows (or something similar to this) in this folder there should be an exe called Galaxy Swapper v2.exe

If this didnt work feel free to contact me on twitter(linked above)
